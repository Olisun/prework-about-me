      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been a big consumer and user of desktop and mobile applications since they were introduced.  However, I am very new to the programming side where I have no experience up to about a month ago.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      <p>I was born in Mountain View and grew up in Redwood City.  I went to college at UC Riverside.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are running (with or without my Labrador Retreiver Taylor) and playing the guitar (acoustic and electric).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is doing something I love and that I'm passionate about.  By doing this, I would not think of it as a "job" but more a calling.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in San Francisco in the SoMa neighborhood</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to become a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to become a web developer because I see coding as a tool and skillset to create the content and applications that I already love to consume and use.  This is very similiar to why I chose to learn to music through playing the guitar some 20 years.  I love listening to music of all kinds so I wanted to learn how to create and produce it on my own.  That process only multiplied my appreciation for my favorite artists and it also opened my eyes and ears to new music I never listened to.  I am expecting the same outcome from my foray into the world of coding.</p>
